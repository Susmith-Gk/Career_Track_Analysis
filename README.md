## 📊 Data Overview  
The dataset includes information on:  
- **Enrollment date**  
- **Career track names**  
- **Completion dates**  
- **Completion status**

## 🔍 Key Findings  

### **1. Monthly Enrollment Trends**  
- The number of enrollments per month shows consistent variation.  
- **August** recorded the highest number of enrollments, exceeding **1,600** enrollments.  

**✅ Possible Reasons:**  
- New academic year or career planning season.  
- Promotional campaigns or discount offers.  
- Increased motivation to upskill before the end of the year.  

---

### **2. Most Popular Career Track**  
- The **Data Analyst** track is the most enrolled track, with **5,130** enrollments (approximately **49%** of total enrollments).  
- The other two tracks, **Data Scientist** and **Business Analyst**, have **3,843** and **1,468** enrollments, respectively.  

**✅ Reason:**  
- High market demand for data analysis skills.  
- Perceived better career opportunities in data-related fields.  

---

### **3. Completion Rate**  
- The completion rate is low, remaining below **2%** consistently.  
- August shows a spike in completion rate, but the trend is inconsistent.  

**✅ Insight:**  
- Students may struggle with consistency or motivation after enrolling.  
- Higher completion in August could reflect better onboarding or a targeted support initiative.

### **4. Typical Completion Duration**  
- Most students complete the track within **91 to 365 days**.  
- Short-term completions (under 30 days) are rare.  

**✅ Best Subscription Model:**  
- An **annual subscription** would be the most suitable since most students take around a year to complete a track.

## 💡 Recommendations  

✅ **1. Improve Onboarding Process**  
- Introduce guided onboarding with clear milestones and expectations.  
- Offer a structured learning path to reduce drop-off.

## ✅ Conclusion  
The analysis highlights that while enrollments are strong, completion rates remain low. By improving the onboarding process, offering more flexible learning options, and introducing gamification, 365 can enhance student motivation and increase the overall completion rate.
